# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This project features a COVID-19 tracker app that for now does not fetch any data from an API, but it does include some cool features such as the 'Tinder-like' swipe on the Deck component, and when the user clicks on the 3 grey dots on the 'Total Cases' card, they are presented with a graph featuring randomized data.

The numbers presented on the home screen have been collected from Google, and the Linear graph generates randomized numbers.
